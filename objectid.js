// "_id": "5cc16427327b6c150b4c50e0",

// the _id property is generated from mongoose

// it represent 12 bytes

//bytes from left to rigth:
// the first 4 bytes represent a timestamp of the present moment
//3 bytes represent a machine identifier, kinda like a mac address
//2 bytes represent a process identifier
//3 bytes represent a counter it is an autoincrementing number. 3bytes = from 0 to 16000000, if all the preciding bytes are the sameif  you have 16M op you generate two equals -id

//the id is generated by the driver so the database dont have to do it and this increase database scalability

//therefore all this make object id having a very precise structure that is evaluated during the validation process. So an id on a query in API can return errors becaure the id is invalid if it do not represent a precise stuctur, if you made up one for example

//low chance of generate the same id in two objects
